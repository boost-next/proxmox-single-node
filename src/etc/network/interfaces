# PVE will preserve source directives, but will NOT read its network
# configuration from sourced files, so do not attempt to move any of
# the PVE managed interfaces into external files!


# ACTIVATE ifaces
# ----------
# ATTENTION !!! the auto statements must be specified BEFORE their
# iface statements. Check that `ipquery -l` will show the correct list
# of interfaces so that `ifup -a` will bring up the ifaces on boot.

# LOOPBACKS
# ----------
#
iface lo inet loopback
iface lo inet6 loopback


# LAN IPv4 - internal network
# ----------
# Bind and access the management interface.

# ----------
